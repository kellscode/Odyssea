Welcome to the Odyssea! Here is how to run our game:

- You will also need to download raylib by typing "opam depext raylib" and 
"opam install raylib" in your terminal 
- If you are using wsl2 and you have not set up an XServer:
  - First download, install, and run VcXsrv from https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
    - Make sure that you run with disable access control ON
  - Open the file ~/.bashrc, and add the following line to the end of it:
   export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0
  - Save the file, and restart wsl2
- You are now ready to play our game. Simply navigate to the correct folder, 
  and type in the terminal "make play"!
  - If you want to reset the saved scores, delete the scores.txt file in bin/
  - Once you have ran make play once, you can run make start to skip any building
- Thank you for downloading and we hope you enjoy the game!
